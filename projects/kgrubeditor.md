> *KGRUBEditor is a KDE utility that edits GRUB’s configuration files through an intuitive user interface. It combines both ease of use with flexibility and is the perfect solution for those who want to configure GRUB without messing with its files.*

Successor of [QGRUBEditor](/projects/qgrubeditor), KGRUBEditor featured the same configurability, combined with a cleaner, simpler and user-friendlier interface. Furthermore, it was written in the KDE4 libs and thus managed higher integration with KDE4’s System Settings. After reaching an acceptable stage of maturity and stability, KGRUBEditor was also discontinued. Its GRUB2 counterpart is [GRUB2 Editor](/projects/grub2-editor).
