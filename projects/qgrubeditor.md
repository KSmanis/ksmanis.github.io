> *QGRUBEditor is a system tool to view and edit the GRUB boot loader. It offers many features and it is the perfect solution for those who want to change the way GRUB works, without messing with GRUB's configuration files.*

QGRUBEditor was my very first open-source project (written in Qt4 libs), which I started back in 2007 in order to learn C++ and Qt. It was a Qt GUI to edit GRUB (Legacy) settings.Â It got some nice coverage and positive reviews, which encouraged me to keep on contributing. As a consequence, half a year after publishing QGRUBEditor, development ceased and QGRUBEditor was replaced by [KGRUBEditor](/projects/kgrubeditor) (written in KDE4 libs).
